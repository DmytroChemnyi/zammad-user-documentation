If a telephone system is connected to Zammad, the connected telephone can be switched on and off.

The caller log displays information on previous and active calls. By clicking on the number (and/or customer name), you can get further information about the customer 
and even create new tickets for the user if needed.

Not all agents have access to the telephone function.
