   Click the **â†’** button in the corner to hide the ticket pane. Click the ðŸ’¬
   tab to bring it back. Click another tab to switch **view modes**.

Here, you can manage virtually every aspect of the ticket, including:

* closing it,
* reopening it,
* postponing it,
* escalating it,
* tagging it,
* assigning it to another agent,
* assigning it to another customer,
* finding other tickets from the same customer,

and much more.

Each of these functions is exposed through one of three different **view
modes**. Read on to find out about the **ticket view**.
