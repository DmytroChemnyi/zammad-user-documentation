"Tickets can get into Zammad via different Channels and can be sorted into "
"different groups each by different criteria. Within Zammad, you can see "
"groups like working groups or departments within a company that can work on "
"different topics."

"**As example:** All Tickets for the Sales-Team can be found within the group"
" \"Sales\", while the Support-Devision (e.g. for your IT) can find their "
"tickets within the group \"Support\". By dividing your departments, your "
"agents only can see what they need and won't get distracted by other "
"tickets. This can also come in handy in case you have departments like legal"
" or accounting that work on information the Sales-Team or Support-Team are "
"not supposed to see."

"You can compare a group to a big cupboard where you sort all your records "

"You can use Roles within Zammad to ensure that your agents can only see "
"groups contents that they are responsible for. An agent can have different "

"Let's stick with the metaphor from before: We have a file (Ticket) in our "
"cupboard that I'm responsible for - I want to work on that file. In this "
"case I'll take the care and I'll work on it. My colleagues can't work on "
"this case. With Zammad, you can assign yourself as an owner of the ticket "
"and you'll get a similar result. *(Side note: Zammad doesn't show the Ticket"
" as \"unassigned\" - other agents can always take a look into the case and "
"add notes or answers if they have the needed rights to do so)*"

"Let's say you notice that you can't process the ticket further, because your"
" colleague is responsible for this. You can then change the owner to them "
"and the ticket shows up in his overview. This is similar to handing him over"
" your file / putting it onto his desk. He'll find the ticket within the "
"overview \"my assigned Tickets\" and also get notified about this action. "

"You can use priorities to realize e.g. reaction times or have special "
"overviews only showing the really important stuff you have to solve before "
"anything else. You can define Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to filter for "
"ticket priorities  and escalate the ticket if the initial answer took too "
"long or to ensure the solving time is respected. This can help you to "
"consider the service contracts of your customers correctly."

"The Admin can create triggers and/or automations that can do several things,"
" if a ticket reaches a certain priority. For example, those actions can be "
"an automated message (customer, agent), the change of a group/owner, setting"
" states and much more...! Here you can find more about Triggers_ and "
