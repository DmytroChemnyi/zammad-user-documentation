"In Zammad, **tickets** are used to track customer service requests. The "
"first time a customer emails you (or the company) about something, Zammad"
" creates a new ticket. Each message sent between you and the customer is "
"added to that ticket until the issue is resolved, the customer is happy, "
"and the ticket is finally **closed**."

"Tickets also have metadata attached to them to make them easier to "

"priority."
