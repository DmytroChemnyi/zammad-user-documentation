Knowledge Base
==============

Manage, edit, and reorganize knowledge base articles from the **knowledge base** panel.

.. note:: **🤔 Huh? I don’t see “Knowledge Base” in the menu...** 

   This feature is **optional**; if you don’t see it in the main menu, that
   means it’s not enabled yet. See the `admin documentation <https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/manage-knowledge-base.html>`_ for details.

Preview Mode
------------

   The knowledge base panel begins in Preview Mode.

Apart from a few small layout differences,
preview mode is identical to the published knowledge base.
As an agent, you will have access to **internal** articles,
which are hidden from the public.

By default, agents are **not permitted to create, edit, or manage knowledge base articles**.
If you wish to edit the knowledge base,
talk to your administrator about granting you the appropriate permissions.

Edit Mode
---------

          to navigate through the knowledge base.

          all of its articles and sub-categories will be relocated with it.

.. note:: 🗑️ Categories can only be deleted once **all of their articles and
          sub-categories** have been deleted or relocated.
