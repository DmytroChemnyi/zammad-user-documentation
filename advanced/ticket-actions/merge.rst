Merging Tickets
===============

.. warning:: ðŸš§ This page is still undergoing revision.

Merge multiple tickets into one.

.. note:: Merging a ticket migrates all messages and notes **out of the original**
   and into the selected one.

   (That is, if youâ€™re viewing Ticket A and :menuselection:`Ticket -->
   Merge` into Ticket B, then **Ticket A will be emptied, archived, and linked
   as a child of Ticket B**.)
