Time Accounting
===============

.. note:: **🤔 Huh? I don’t see a “Time Accounting” dialog...** 

   This feature is **optional**; if you don’t see it in the main menu, that
   means it’s not enabled yet. See the `admin documentation <https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/manage-time-accounting.html>`_ for details.

Zammad supports detailed time accounting
to help administrators keep track of how much time you spend
on any given ticket, customer or client organization.

   If time accounting is enabled,
   this dialog will appear each time you update a ticket.
   Enter how much time you spent on it
   (in minutes, or whichever unit of time all your other colleagues are using).
