Working with Text Modules
=========================

Zammad offers so called text modules.
Text modules will help you to improve your workflow, as you don't have to type your answer 
on every ticket by hand. You can simply choose a fitting text module and insert it into the E-Mail.

To access available text modules, simply type ``::`` within an article body. 
If you found the right text module, just press enter or click with your left mouse and Zammad will insert the modules Text at the place your cursor is.

.. Tip:: You can either scroll through all modules (mouse or direction keys), type the module name or enter a keyword (if keywords are set).

.. Note:: **ðŸ¤” Huh? Some text modules are missing in some groups...?**
  
  Zammad allows group-dependent Text Modules which will only display group specific Text Modules if the group is selected.
  You don't have to update the tickets group to use group-dependent Text Modules, changing the group without udpating is enough.
