Working with Text Modules
=========================

Zammad offers so called text modules.
Text modules will help you to improve your workflow, as you don't have to answer 
on every ticket by hand. You can simply choose a fitting module and insert it to the E-Mail.

To access available text modules, simply type ``::`` within an article body. 
If you found the right text module, just press enter or click with your left mouse and Zammad will insert the modules Text at the place your cursor is.

.. Tip:: You can either scroll through all modules (mouse or direction keys), type the module name or enter a keyword (if keywords are set).

Text modules on ticket creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use text modules on ticket creation as well, but on ticket creation, our :ref:`ticket_templates` might get handy.


Changing text modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For changing text modules, you need to have the right to do so.
