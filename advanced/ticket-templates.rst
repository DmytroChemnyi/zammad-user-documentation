Ticket Templates
================

If you find yourself creating lots of tickets with the same basic attributes,
use **ticket templates** to fill them in next time with a single click.

   :alt: Ticket template dialog
   :align: center

   Use the ticket pane to load or create ticket templates.

To create a new template, start by filling in a new ticket as usual.
Then, instead of submitting the ticket form,
use the **template dialog** in the ticket pane
to enter a name for your new template, and click “Save”.

The next time you create a ticket,
you’ll find your new template in the “Select template” dropdown.
Click it to apply your saved attributes to the new ticket.

.. hint:: Any template created by any agent will be available to **all** agents.
