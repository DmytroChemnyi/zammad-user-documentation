Collaborating on a Ticket
=========================

There are two common approaches for agents to share work on the same ticket in
Zammad: **tag-teaming tickets** and **splitting tickets**.

When tag-teaming, one agent takes responsibility for 

Variant 2 describes the separation of tickets. An article of an existing ticket
is split off as an independent ticket and can be further processed separately.
Consult the :doc:`splitting tickets </advanced/ticket-actions/split>` article
for more.

Approach 1: Tag Team
--------------------

A ticket arrives at the customer service and is edited/categorized by an agent. Further processing by another agent or more detailed information is necessary to work on the ticket.

In this example, a phone ticket was created. The original owner has already assigned the group (Sales). All responsible agents assigned to this group will now be notified about 
the new ticket and can set themselves or somone else as owner. If necessary, you can also set the status and the priority (and any other fields individually created by the admin) 
in the same step. It is recommended to add a note for each action so that others can follow the ticketâ€™s progress.
