Ticket Overviews
==================

.. image:: images/gettingstarted/Zammad_Helpdesk_-_Overview.jpg

Zammad provides the following overviews by default:

1)	My assigned tickets
2)	Unassigned & Open
3)	My pending reached Tickets
4)	Open
5)	Pending reached
6)	Escalated

Views 1 and 3 refer to the tickets assigned to the current agent. All other overviews show tickets of all agents.
By clicking on the column headings these can be displayed in an order.

You can adjust the column width as required by dragging the column to the desired width. This adjustment remains saved for the logged in user in this way.

Tab bar
--------------

On the left side, below the dashboard, the search and features such as chat or phone, is the so-called tab bar:

This allows you to open and edit several tabs at the same time.

What can be opened as a tab?

- Existing tickets (1)
- Ticket creation mask (2)
- User detail view (3)
- Organization detail view (4)
- Searches submitted (5)

You can work on all open tabs at the same time. The changes are saved automatically (on the server). The order of the tabs can be changed via drag & drop. The (unsaved!) ticket content and order of the tabs remains unchanged, even after logging off and on.

The "pulsing" of the circle symbols indicates that there has been a change since the ticket was last called.


The colors of the symbols are based on the traffic light system:

:green:  The ticket is closed - no further work necessary.

:black: A reminder has been set but has not been reached - currently no work necessary.

:yellow:  The ticket is new/open or the reminder time has been reached - the ticket must be worked on.

:red: The ticket has escalated - the ticket needs urgent work to stop the escalation.
