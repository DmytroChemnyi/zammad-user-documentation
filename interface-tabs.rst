Tabs
====

As you click through Zammad, you will see a list of entries appear in the left pane. These are your **open tabs.**

You can freely switch between open tabs without losing your work – all unsaved changes are automatically backed up to the server.

UI Tips
-------

* Ticket statuses are **color-coded:**

  :Green:  **Closed**
  :Black:  **Postponed** (Marked as pending; no immediate action required.)
  :Yellow: **Ready for action**
  :Red:    **Escalated** (Requires urgent attention.)
* A **pulsing dot** means that a ticket has new activity since you last viewed it.
* Drag and drop tabs to rearrange them.
