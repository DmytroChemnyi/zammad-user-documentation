Method 1 - Handing over Tickets
===============================

A ticket arrives at the customer service and is edited/categorized by an agent. Further processing by another agent or more detailed information is necessary to work on the ticket.

In this example, a phone ticket was created. The original owner has already assigned the group (Sales). All responsible agents assigned to this group will now be notified about 
the new ticket and can set themselves or somone else as owner. If necessary, you can also set the status and the priority (and any other fields individually created by the admin) 
in the same step. It is recommended to add a note for each action so that others can follow the ticketâ€™s progress.
