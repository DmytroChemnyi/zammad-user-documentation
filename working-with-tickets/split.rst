Method 2 - Splitting tickets
=============================

If parts of a ticket must be processed by different persons/departments, it is useful to split the ticket. 
Especially for processes which have different durations this method is recommended. 
Click the “split” button below the article:

This leads to the “normal” ticket creation dialog. 
In addition, all the information that was stored in the ticket, including the content of the respective article, is also included:.

You can now select whether this ticket will be created as an inbound/outbound phone call or email. 
The customer’s information can also be customized before creating a new ticket.

The split ticket contains the information about the original ‘parent’ ticket it was split from. 
Information about parent and child links can be viewed in the ticket information. 
Links can be removed by clicking the cross icon next to the link.
