Browse for Tickets
==================

Looking for a ticket to work on? Check the **overviews** menu.

   :align: center

   Click **Overviews** in the main menu to browse tickets.

.. hint:: 📥 Think of overviews as **inboxes**, each with a different filter
   for the tickets it displays.

There are **six built-in overviews** (Zammad admin may `create more`_ with
custom-defined filters):

* **My assigned tickets** (open/pending only)
* **Unassigned & Open**
* **My pending reached tickets** (previously marked “pending” and currently due)
* **Open** (system-wide)
* **Pending reached** (system-wide, previously marked “pending” and currently due)
* **Escalated** (system-wide)

.. tip:: **🖱️ UI Protip**

   * Click on column headings to change the display order.
   * Click-and-drag column dividers to adjust their width.
