Priority
========

A ticket’s **priority** is simply a ranking (from 1 to 3)
of *how urgent or important it is*.

But what does it do, and how should I use it?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Out of the box, **ticket priority doesn’t actually do anything**.
However, Zammad administrators can set up all sorts of automated hooks
that fire off based on this value, like:

   * `service-level agreements`_,
   * `triggers`_, and
   * `scheduled events`_.

Priority can also be used as a ticket filter when creating `custom overviews`_.

In other words, **consult your administrator**
for details on how he’d like you to use it.
