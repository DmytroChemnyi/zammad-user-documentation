Priority
========

.. warning:: ðŸš§ This page is still undergoing revision.

You can use priorities to realize e.g. reaction times or have special overviews only showing the really important stuff you have to solve before anything else.
You can define Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to filter for ticket priorities  and escalate the ticket if the initial answer took too long or to ensure the solving time is respected.
This can help you to consider the service contracts of your customers correctly.

The Admin can create triggers and/or automations that can do several things, if a ticket reaches a certain priority. 
For example, those actions can be an automated message (customer, agent), the change of a group/owner, setting states and much more...! 
Here you can find more about Triggers_ and Automations_.
