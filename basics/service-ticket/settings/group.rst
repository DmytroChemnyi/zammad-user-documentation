Tickets can get into Zammad via different Channels and can be sorted into different groups each by different criteria.
Within Zammad, you can see groups like working groups or departments within a company that can work on different topics.

**As example:** All Tickets for the Sales-Team can be found within the group "Sales", while the Support-Devision (e.g. for your IT) can find their tickets within the group "Support".
By dividing your departments, your agents only can see what they need and won't get distracted by other tickets.
This can also come in handy in case you have departments like legal or accounting that work on information the Sales-Team or Support-Team are not supposed to see.

You can compare a group to a big cupboard where you sort all your records (Tickets) you need to work on.
Every Agent of the Team (Group) has access to this cupboard and can work on your cases (Tickets).

You can use Roles within Zammad to ensure that your agents can only see groups contents that they are responsible for. 
An agent can have different rights on groups: You can determine if the agents shall only have read-, move- or creation-rights on a group.
