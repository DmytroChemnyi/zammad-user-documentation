Often, you will assign tickets to yourself
(like when you choose an issue to work on from a pool of new tickets).
Sometimes, complicated issues will require a ticket
to be passed back and forth between multiple agents
before it can be closed.
In such cases, a colleague may assign a ticket to you (or vice versa)
after it has been partially resolved.

Let's stick with the metaphor from before: We have a file (Ticket) in our cupboard that I'm responsible for - I want to work on that file.
In this case I'll take the care and I'll work on it. My colleagues can't work on this case.
With Zammad, you can assign yourself as an owner of the ticket and you'll get a similar result. 
*(Side note: Zammad doesn't show the Ticket as "unassigned" - other agents can always take a look into the case and add notes or answers if they have the needed rights to do so)*

Let's say you notice that you can't process the ticket further, because your colleague is responsible for this. You can then change the owner to them and the ticket shows up in his overview.
This is similar to handing him over your file / putting it onto his desk.
He'll find the ticket within the overview "my assigned Tickets" and also get notified about this action. (please see noification settings within profile)
