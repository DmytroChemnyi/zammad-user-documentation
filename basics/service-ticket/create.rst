Creating a Ticket
=================

Zammad does its best to create tickets automatically
when new customer issues come your way.
But sometimes,
there‚Äôs just no way for Zammad to know when an issue arrives ‚Äì
like when a customer calls on the phone.

In these cases, Zammad needs your help to **create a new ticket**.

   Click the **‚ûï button** to create a new ticket. The default ticket type is **received call**.

An agent can create three types of tickets:

:Received Call: for issues **initiated by a customer** over the phone.
:Outbound Call: for issues **initiated by an agent** over the phone.
:Send Email:    for issues **initiated by an agent** over email.

Input Fields
------------

Title
   The title of the ticket will be used as the **subject line**
   for all email correspondences.

Customer
   When entering a customer,
   the autocomplete menu searches for **email addresses only**.
   You **must** select an option from the autocomplete menu,
   or else create a new customer.

      Once a customer has been selected,
      her profile will be accessible from the **ticket pane**.
