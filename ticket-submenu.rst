You can use this function to merge multiple tickets into one.
You can enter the ticket number of the ticket you want to merge into another ticket in the text field (1) of the merge mask.
Below, Zammad shows you ticket that may match the topic - with selecting (2) one of those, you can also merge tickets.
The merge process will be done with pressing "Submit". Please note that after merging, the old ticket is no longer available stand alone.
