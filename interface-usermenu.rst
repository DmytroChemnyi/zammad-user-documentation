By checking the box on the right side, you will receive additional (!) e-mail notifications about the activity in Zammad (The content of this system message cannot be configured via the interface).

A restriction to ticket-notofications within certain groups can be made. If you do not want to be informed about tickets of a group, the check mark can be removed accordingly.

In addition, the sound can be defined for an incoming notification.

:Out of Office: 
    A replacement can be entered for the time you cannot process tickets. The deputy receives notifications about changes of the tickets assigned to you within the defined time. In addition, all tickets you own are listed in a separate overview for that person. 
	
    **Please note:**  The Out of Office function does **not** disable notifications for the original agent!

:Calendar: To display your own tickets in your own calendar app, the corresponding link can be viewed here.

:Devices: All computers and browsers that have/have access to your Zammad are displayed here.

:Token Access: Generate a personal access token for each application that should access the Zammad API.
