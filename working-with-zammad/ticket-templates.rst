If agents need to create tickets with similar content, they can be stored as ticket templates, in order to accelerate the ticketing process in the future. 
The following ticket information can be put into a template: ticket type, customer, title, text, group, owner, status, priority and tags.

You can access the templates by clicking on the paper icon, as shown in the following figure:

When you create a new template, all the required information is entered in the ticket and an appropriate name is selected, which is entered in the field "Save as template". After clicking on "Save", the template can be selected during the future ticketing process.
