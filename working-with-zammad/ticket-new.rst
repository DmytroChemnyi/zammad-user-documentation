Create new tickets
====================

A new ticket is created by clicking on the plus icon at the bottom left. This leads to the following dialog:

The channel or article type can be selected in the upper part. In this example, an incoming call is selected. You can also specify the title, which is the title of the ticket as well as the subject for email tickets. When you select the customer name, the system proposes possible customers that are stored in Zammad when you make an entry. After selecting the customer user, customer information is available in the right-hand window on the Customer-Icon:

If the customer does not yet exist in the customer database, this can be created by "Create customer":

The corresponding content is entered in the text field. It is possible to "drag" images directly into the text and also to copy and paste preformatted texts from e.g. Word into the text field. The formatting (as far as it can be displayed in Zammad) is retained. You can also upload attachments by clicking on "Select files".

Below the text field, the group to process the ticket is selected. If this field is displayed (for a possible selection of at least 2 groups), it must always be selected as mandatory field. Depending on the group, a signature is automatically stored for email tickets (if this is maintained).
Additionally, the owner of the ticket can be defined. This field is optional. This allows the agents of the selected group to subsequently define the responsible owner.
In the standard system there is also the field "status" (mandatory) as well as a ticket "priority" which can be selected.

If "E-Mail" is selected as channel, it is also possible to enter a CC address.
